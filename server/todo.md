# Todo List

## Things to Do

- [x] Do everything for the similarly for the CVE data as done for the CVE list.   
- [] logging files inteegration
- [x] frontend needed codes to the server files.
- [] Design for the frontend files
- [x] Fix integrityImpact issue with second phase data not being added properly to the database.
- [x] Find a way to determine the number of records available in the API endpoint at a particular point of time.
- [] Change API integration
- [] Add the last added offset to the db 
- [] Change the code of the initial synchronization to add the background sync model at every chunk insertion, so even if there is a fail at the middle of the initial sync, after the server starts again, that will be handled by the update Synchronization function , so that we update the lastupdated key and last updated offset key in the background sync model in the db
- [] I need to change the limit and increamental runnning process to the intial sync function for determine where to stop the start index increamentation
- [] i think implementing recursion could solve the above problem, we will not call the function again and again by checking with the limit, we will call the function recursively when the current total number of cves in exactly 2 thousand, so there may be a chance of having some other cves,
- [] i think the above can be done with the help of checking the current results per page of the current api call, if it is 2000 i will recursively call with plus 2000
- [] i need to check whether this will cause a potential degradation in the app due to stack over flow errors

### Note to understand 
       - [] if there is backgroundSync model, the we get the startIndex from it, and update the BackgroundSync model in the db
       - [] orelse we initialize the startIndex as 0 and create the BackgroundSync model in the db



- [] change the name of the initil Sync to  syncNew cves or something like that
